## Define exclude files

A .backupman.excludes file specifies intentionally unsync files that Rsync should ignore.
Files already synced by Rsync are deleted; see the NOTES below for details.

.backupman.excludes file MUST BE located at TOP OF BACKUP SOURCE.

backupman sync .backupman.excludes first than sycn other.

### Examples

```
/mnt
/proc
/tmp
/sys
/dev
/run
/sys/fs/cgroup
```
